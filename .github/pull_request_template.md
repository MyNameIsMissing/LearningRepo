#### Functionality Checks

[comment]: # (Make sure you have MANUALLY tested your code. Don't rely on automated tests.)

- [ ] Code is functional.

[comment]: # "Github runs several automated checks, including Rubocop, via CodeClimate. It's not uncommon for pre-existing code edited in a minor way (i.e., indentation) to fail for other pre-existing reasons. If that occurs, explain it here, and request that the reviewer approve the failures."

- [ ] Automated checks pass, if applicable. If CodeClimate checks do not pass, explain reason for failures:

- [ ] If your changes will be tested manually, you have run `bundle update` and committed your changes to Gemfile.lock.

[comment]: # (Unlike Travis CI, CircleCi does not test PRs with the combined changes of the PR and master. For this reason, it's necessary to manually merge master into the PR branch, to ensure the combined code does not fail automated tests.)

- [ ] You have merged the latest changes from the target branch (usually `master` or `main`) into your branch.
